    print(f"Account: {ib.managedAccounts()}")
    ib.disconnect()

## 🔄 Next Steps

### For Beginners:
1. **Read the full [README.md](README.md)** to understand the strategy
2. **Try different symbols** (SPY, AAPL, TSLA)
3. **Experiment with parameters** using [CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md](CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)

### For Intermediate Users:
1. **Run the parameter optimization** script
2. **Test with live data** (still using paper trading)
3. **Set up monitoring and alerts**

### Before Live Trading:
1. **✅ Test thoroughly** with paper trading for at least 1 month
2. **✅ Understand** all strategy parameters and risks
3. **✅ Start small** with position sizes you can afford to lose
4. **✅ Monitor constantly** during live trading

---

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues?**
- ✅ Make sure IB Gateway is running and logged in
- ✅ Check API is enabled (see Step 3 above)
- ✅ Try port 4001 (paper) or 4002 (live)

**No Data?**
- ✅ Ensure market is open (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- ✅ Try QQQ first (most reliable data)
- ✅ Check your IBKR market data subscriptions

**Import Errors?**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas numpy ib-insync matplotlib
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with paper trading** - it's identical to live trading but with virtual money
2. **QQQ is the best symbol for beginners** - highly liquid with consistent behavior
3. **Run backtests on different time periods** to validate strategy robustness
4. **Monitor your first live trades closely** - automated doesn't mean unattended
5. **Keep position sizes small initially** - you can always scale up later
