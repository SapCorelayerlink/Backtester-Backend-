# IBKR-Only Trading System Setup

## 🚀 System Changes

The trading system has been updated to **only support IBKR (Interactive Brokers)** as the broker. The mock broker has been completely removed to ensure all testing and trading is done with real market data and conditions.

## ✅ What Was Removed

- ❌ `brokers/mock_broker.py` - Mock broker implementation
- ❌ All mock broker imports and references
- ❌ Mock broker usage in test files
- ❌ Mock broker API endpoints

## 🔧 What Was Updated

### API Files
- `api/main.py` - Removed mock broker imports
- All broker references now point to IBKR only

### Test Files
- `test_full_backtest.py` - Now uses IBKRBroker
- `test_backtest_results.py` - Now uses IBKRBroker  
- `test_save_results.py` - Now uses IBKRBroker
- `test_imports.py` - Removed mock broker imports

### Documentation
- `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` - Updated to use IBKR
- `scripts/test_data_endpoint.sh` - Updated comments
- `tests/ibkr_api_curl_tester.sh` - Updated to use IBKR
- `websocket_client_example.py` - Updated WebSocket URI

## 🧪 Testing Without Mock Broker

Since the mock broker has been removed, all testing now requires:

### 1. IBKR Connection Setup
```bash
# Install IB Gateway or TWS
# Enable API access on port 4001 (Gateway) or 7497 (TWS)
# Ensure your IBKR account is active
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Set up your IBKR credentials
# Ensure IB Gateway/TWS is running
# Test connection before running tests
```

### 3. Running Tests
```bash
# Test IBKR connection first
python test_connection.py

# Run full system tests (requires IBKR connection)
python test_full_backtest.py

# Test API endpoints
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

## 📊 Benefits of IBKR-Only Setup

✅ **Real Market Conditions** - All testing uses actual market data  
✅ **Accurate Results** - No simulated data that might not reflect real conditions  
✅ **Production Ready** - Same environment for testing and live trading  
✅ **Simplified Codebase** - No need to maintain mock implementations  
✅ **Better Risk Management** - Real market conditions help identify actual risks  

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **IBKR Account Required** - You need an active IBKR account for testing
2. **Market Hours** - Some tests may only work during market hours
3. **Data Costs** - Real market data may have associated costs
4. **Paper Trading** - Use IBKR paper trading account for safe testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Setup IBKR Gateway/TWS**
2. **Enable API access** (port 4001 for Gateway, 7497 for TWS)
3. **Test connection**: `python test_connection.py`
4. **Run tests**: `python test_full_backtest.py`

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues with IBKR connection:
- Check IBKR Gateway/TWS is running
- Verify API settings are correct
- Ensure your account has market data permissions
- Check firewall settings for port access

**The system is now streamlined for production use with real market data and conditions.**
