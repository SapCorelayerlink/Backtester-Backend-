## üîë Step 3: First Login and Basic Setup

### Launch IB Gateway

1. **Start the Application**:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the desktop icon or find in Start Menu
   - **Mac**: Open from Applications folder
   - **Linux**: Run from installation directory

2. **Initial Screen**:
   - You'll see the IB Gateway login window
   - It should look like a simple login form

### Login to Your Account

1. **Enter Your Credentials**:
   - **Username**: Your IBKR username
   - **Password**: Your IBKR password

2. **Choose Trading Mode**:
   - **Paper Trading** (RECOMMENDED): Use virtual money, no risk
   - **Live Trading**: Real money trading (only after you're comfortable)

3. **Select Server**:
   - **US**: For most US-based users
   - **Hong Kong**: For Asian users
   - **Europe**: For European users

4. **Click "Login"**:
   - First login may take 30-60 seconds
   - You may see security prompts - click "Accept"

### Understanding the Gateway Interface

After login, you'll see a small window with:
- **Connection status** (should show "Connected")
- **Account information**
- **Menu bar** with settings

**Important**: Keep this window open while running trading strategies!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Enable API Access (CRITICAL STEP)

This is the most important step - without API access, the trading strategy cannot connect.

### Open API Settings

1. **In IB Gateway Window**:
   - Click **"Configure"** in the menu bar
   - Select **"Settings"** from the dropdown
   - Choose **"API"** from the left sidebar
   - Click **"Settings"** under the API section

### Configure API Settings

You'll see a window with several options. Configure each as follows:

#### ‚úÖ Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients
- **Check the box** next to "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"
- This allows external programs (like our strategy) to connect

#### ‚úÖ Socket Port
- **Paper Trading**: Set to `4002`
- **Live Trading**: Set to `4001`
- This is the "address" our strategy will use to connect

#### ‚úÖ Master API Client ID
- Set to `1000` (or any number above 100)
- This prevents conflicts with manual trading

#### ‚úÖ Read-Only API
- **Leave UNCHECKED** if you want to place trades
- **Check** if you only want to test data connections (no trading)

#### ‚úÖ Trusted IPs
- Click the **"+"** button
- Add: `127.0.0.1`
- This allows connections from your local computer

### Apply Settings

1. Click **"OK"** to save settings
2. Click **"OK"** again to close the settings window
3. **Restart IB Gateway** (important for settings to take effect):
   - Close IB Gateway completely
   - Restart it and log in again

---

## üß™ Step 5: Set Up Paper Trading (Highly Recommended)

Paper trading lets you test strategies with virtual money - no financial risk!

### Access Paper Trading

1. **During Login**:
   - Select **"Paper Trading"** instead of "Live Trading"
   - Everything else remains the same

2. **Paper Trading Features**:
   - ‚úÖ $1,000,000 virtual starting capital
   - ‚úÖ Real market data and prices
   - ‚úÖ Same interface as live trading
   - ‚úÖ No risk to your real money
   - ‚úÖ Perfect for testing strategies

### Verify Paper Trading Setup

1. **After Login**:
   - Look for "Paper Trading" indicator in the Gateway window
   - Account number should start with "DU" (Demo User)

2. **Test Order (Optional)**:
   - You can manually place a test order to verify everything works
   - Buy 1 share of QQQ to confirm order routing

---

## üîå Step 6: Test Your Connection

Before running the full strategy, let's test the connection.

### Quick Connection Test

1. **Ensure IB Gateway is Running**:
   - Window should show "Connected"
   - API should be enabled (from Step 4)

2. **Test with Python**:
   ```python
   from ib_insync import IB
   
   # Create connection
   ib = IB()
   
   try:
       # Connect (use 4001 for paper trading, 4002 for live)
ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 4001, clientId=1)
       print("‚úÖ SUCCESS: Connected to IBKR Gateway!")
       
       # Get account info
       accounts = ib.managedAccounts()
       print(f"üìä Account(s): {accounts}")
       
       # Disconnect
       ib.disconnect()
       print("üîå Disconnected cleanly")
       
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"‚ùå ERROR: {e}")
       print("üîç Check that:")
       print("   - IB Gateway is running and logged in")
       print("   - API is enabled in Gateway settings")
       print("   - Port 4001 is set for paper trading")
   ```

3. **Run the Test**:
   - Save the code above as `test_connection.py`
   - Run: `python test_connection.py`
   - You should see the success message

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Connection Refused" Error

**Symptoms**: 
```
[WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection
```

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Check IB Gateway is Running**: Look for the Gateway window
2. ‚úÖ **Verify Login**: Make sure you're logged into Gateway
3. ‚úÖ **Check Port Number**: 4001 for paper, 4002 for live
4. ‚úÖ **Restart Gateway**: Close completely and restart
5. ‚úÖ **Check Firewall**: Windows may be blocking the connection

### Issue 2: "clientId Already in Use"

**Symptoms**:
```
clientId 1 is already in use
```

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Change Client ID**: Use a different number (2, 3, 4, etc.)
2. ‚úÖ **Close Other Connections**: Make sure no other programs are connected
3. ‚úÖ **Restart Gateway**: This clears all existing connections

### Issue 3: "API Not Enabled"

**Symptoms**:
```
API not enabled or connection limit exceeded
```

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Re-check API Settings**: Follow Step 4 again carefully
2. ‚úÖ **Verify "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" is checked**
3. ‚úÖ **Restart Gateway** after changing settings
4. ‚úÖ **Check Connection Limit**: Only a few API connections allowed simultaneously

### Issue 4: "No Market Data"

**Symptoms**: Connection works but no price data

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Check Market Hours**: US stock market is open 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
2. ‚úÖ **Verify Market Data Subscriptions**: Some symbols require paid data
3. ‚úÖ **Try QQQ First**: It's included in most basic subscriptions
4. ‚úÖ **Check Symbol Format**: Use "QQQ" not "NASDAQ:QQQ"

### Issue 5: "Permission Denied for Trading"

**Symptoms**: Can connect but can't place orders

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Uncheck "Read-Only API"** in Gateway settings
2. ‚úÖ **Use Paper Trading** for testing (safer)
3. ‚úÖ **Check Account Permissions**: Some restrictions may apply to new accounts
4. ‚úÖ **Verify Sufficient Buying Power** in account
